The next project idea is to build a skill verification system. On social media platforms, people make any claim about themselves which is often taken as the truth even if it’s not. This skill verification system would validate skills in a simple and objective way including decentralized consensus. Examples of skills would be judged anonymously by random other users. They would verify and validate the claim and get rewarded for their work. For example, if someone is an expert in react.js, they put up a claim and attach proof such as their Github repos then other members in the same domain would verify it. And based on the consensus, the claim is either ‘endorsed’ or ‘flagged’. You can try building this application using ethereum smart contracts.
