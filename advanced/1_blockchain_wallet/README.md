The first advanced blockchain project idea is – Blockchain Wallet. There are so many cryptocurrency users out there and they want something to manage their funds. Blockchain wallets will allow them to hold these funds and transfer them to some other wallets as well. Some examples of blockchain wallets are trusted wallets, Coinbase wallet, and Argent wallet. The main use case of such wallets is to hold cryptocurrencies. But also some wallets work as dapp browsers as well. Essentially they have a built-in web browser that lets you use blockchain-based applications. Blockchain applications need a way to sign transactions with the user’s private key and this is what these wallets allow to do. Now how would you build something like this?. You can use React Native or Flutter to build the native application. Now you need to connect this application to the blockchain. To do this, web3.js would be helpful. As discussed earlier, Web3.js is a library that turns your web application into a blockchain website.
