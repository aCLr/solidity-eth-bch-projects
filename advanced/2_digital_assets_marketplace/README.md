The next project idea is Digital Asset Marketplace. So many people hold digital collectibles (digital assets) and they need a place to buy and sell them. Digital asset marketplaces or DAM provide a complete framework for their users. DAM act as a trusted intermediary between issuers and investors of digital assets. They propose a set of tools and services to facilitate transactions between the different users. To build this kind of application you would require some ethereum smart contracts written in the solidity programming language. You would require a web application and web3.js library to turn this web application into a blockchain website.
