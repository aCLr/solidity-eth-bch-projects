Idea: The next project idea that you can implement is a simple storage smart contract. In this contract, you can take an integer variable and make sure that you are able to read this variable and also update its value. You can define two functions one for incrementing the value of the declared variable and the other for decrementing the value. So now you can build smart contracts that are not read-only but you can actually modify the data. And once you know how to modify the data in a smart contract you can extend its functionality by adding more functions to it and make it more practical.
