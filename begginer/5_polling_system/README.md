Idea: The next project idea is a polling smart contract. In this polling system, people would be able to create a new poll, and in that poll, they would be able to mention different choices. Users would place their vote for one of the mentioned choices. You’ll set a voting period and everybody will be able to vote. At the end of the voting period, one of the choices would be the winner. These polls can be related to any topic. If you do this smart contract you will need to deal with addresses, you’ll discover more advanced data structures like hashmap. You’ll also learn how to deal with time in solidity while implementing voting period functionality, so it’s going to be a little more interesting. This is a slightly difficult project and you can mention this project in your portfolio as well.
