Idea: The next idea is to build a blockchain application that can send ethers to multiple ethereum addresses. Just like for sending an email you use the email address of another user, for sending ethers you use an ethereum address. So using this application users would be able to send ethers to a list of ethereum addresses. This application can be very useful in the case of sending salary to employees. Now to build this project you need to write an ethereum smart contract. You can use REMIX IDE to do so. Remix is an online IDE for making smart contracts using solidity language. You just need to declare a function that will take an array of addresses as the argument and inside the function, you need to run a simple for loop. After doing the above projects you will be able to do this project very easily without any tutorial.
