Idea: The very first project idea that you can implement is just to print a string “Hello, World!”. This is going to be a very simple smart contract that returns the string “Hello, World!”. Although it sounds like a very simple idea, but if you’re a beginner this will teach you a lot of things. It will teach you all the basics of a blockchain project. It will teach you the layout of a solidity file, how to declare contracts, how to declare a function and so many basic things.
