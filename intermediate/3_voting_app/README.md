The third intermediate blockchain project idea is to build a Voting system. Voting is a very good example of how blockchain and smart contracts can be used in order to bring trust and transparency to the system. This application can be useful for conducting voting at the organizational level as well as at the national level. While building this project you need to make sure of some things in order to make your voting system work. First, details of the users should be hidden in your application due to privacy issues. In order to do this, you need to use an ethereum address which really will be the only identifier for the users. Second, one person should be able to place only one vote, and that too only when theyâ€™re eligible. Next, it should be transparent with a condition that all the rules of voting are being followed. Then of course we need the votes to be accurately recorded and counted. There should not be any kind of mistake or possibility of fraud in the voting system. All this will be done using solidity. Have fun with this project!
