The next project idea is to build a savings and lending application. Decentralized finance or DeFi is a big trend right now. DeFi is basically a way of taking existing financial solutions and putting them over to the blockchain. Saving and lending is a category where people are doing this a lot. Using this application, people would be able to take loans on the blockchains. That means they can essentially lock up certain assets and borrow other cryptocurrencies and then pay back later after a certain amount of time. A different use case for this kind of application is cryptocurrency trading. Traders can lock up certain cryptocurrency assets to borrow a different kind of asset, then trade it and make a profit. Now let’s discuss what kind of technology would you need to build this. Smart contracts will be the major part of such applications. You need to write smart contracts with the solidity programming language and then deploy them in the blockchain. The smart contract will have all the business logic to manage the saving and lending protocols. In the future, there’s gonna be room for multiple types of products like this because just like there are multiple cryptocurrency exchanges there can be multiple lending and savings platforms because people are always looking for competitive rates.
