The final idea of a blockchain-based project in the intermediate category is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. This would be a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange that means it won’t be live on a server somewhere. It will allow you to own and control the private keys to your cryptocurrency. There are so many cryptocurrency users out there and they all want to trade their cryptocurrency at some point in time and a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange would allow them to do this. An example of such an application is Idex. Now how to build this decentralized cryptocurrency exchange? To build this, you would need to create some smart contracts that handle the trading. Your application should be able to trade any type of ethereum assets, ethereum cryptocurrency itself, and any ethereum based tokens. Once you have the smart contracts in place to do this you would need some sort of client-side interface so that people can interact with your application and use it. For making the interface, you can use any backend framework like React.js, Node.js, Angular, Django, etc. Now in order to convert your web application into a blockchain application, you’ll also need some sort of library. A library that turns your web application into a blockchain website and that’s where web3.js come. Web3.js allows you to talk to smart contracts inside a regular website.
